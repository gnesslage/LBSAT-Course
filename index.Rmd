# Syllabus
## Workshop description
This webinar-based workshop series will provide participants with an introduction to length-based data analysis and stock assessment techniques from data-limited approaches to statistical catch-at-length methods. The workshop will involve a combination of lectures, readings, hands-on exercises, and discussion. Breakout groups will work cooperatively to analyze data, explore modeling techniques, and interpret model output. Guest speakers from agencies and academia will provide presentations on the application of length-based assessment techniques in research and management and engage students in discussion about careers in quantitative fisheries science.

## Instructor
Genny Nesslage (she/her) is an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science <a href="https://www.umces.edu/cbl" style="color: DarkOrchid; text-decoration: bold;">Chesapeake Biological Laboratory</a>.

## Enrollment and pre-requisites
This free online workshop is open to 20 current students and post-docs and will not be offered for credit. Participants are expected to have completed a basic stock assessment or population dynamics course, be familiar with data analysis in R, and have a willingness to learn to run other code provided (e.g., AD Model Builder) with instruction. To express interest in the workshop, please <a href="https://forms.gle/rd9BtSX6LjVUP8c6A" style="color: DarkOrchid; text-decoration: bold;">complete this online form</a> by July 8, 2022.
