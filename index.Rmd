# Syllabus
## Workshop description
This webinar-based workshop series will provide participants with an introduction to length-based data analysis and stock assessment techniques from data-limited approaches to statistical catch-at-length methods. The workshop will involve a combination of lectures, readings, hands-on exercises, and discussion. Breakout groups will work cooperatively to analyze data and interpret model output. Guest speakers from agencies and academia will provide presentations on the application of length-based assessment techniques in research and management and engage students in discussion about careers in quantitative fisheries science.

## Instructor
Genny Nesslage (she/her) is an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science <a href="https://www.umces.edu/cbl" style="color: DarkOrchid; text-decoration: bold;">Chesapeake Biological Laboratory</a>.

## Enrollment and pre-requisites
This workshop is open to current students and post-docs. Participants are expected to have completed a basic stock assessment or population dynamics course, be familiar with data analysis in R, and have a willingness to learn to run other code provided (e.g., AD Model Builder) with instruction. To express interest in the course, please
<a href="https://forms.gle/rd9BtSX6LjVUP8c6A" style="color: DarkOrchid; text-decoration: bold;">complete this online form</a> by June 3, 2022. Students and post-docs enrolled in programs associated with NOAA's QUEST program and/or at CINAR institutions and  will be given first priority. All finalized course materials will be available to the public <a href="https://github.com/gnesslage/LBCourse" style="color: DarkOrchid; text-decoration: bold;">on Github</a> in January 2023.
