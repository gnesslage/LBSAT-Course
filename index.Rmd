# Syllabus
## Workshop description
This webinar-based workshop series will provide participants with an introduction to length-based data analysis and stock assessment techniques from data-limited approaches to statistical catch-at-length methods. The workshop will involve a combination of lectures, readings, hands-on exercises, and discussion. Breakout groups will work cooperatively to analyze data, explore modeling techniques, and interpret model output. Guest speakers from agencies and academia will provide presentations on the application of length-based assessment techniques in research and management and engage students in discussion about careers in quantitative fisheries science.
