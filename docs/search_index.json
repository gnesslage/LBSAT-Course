The workshop will involve a combination of lectures, readings, hands-on exercises, and discussion. Breakout groups will work cooperatively to analyze data, explore modeling techniques, and interpret model output. Guest speakers from agencies and academia will provide presentations on the application of length-based assessment techniques in research and management and engage students in discussion about careers in quantitative fisheries science. 1.2 Instructor Genny Nesslage (she/her) is an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Chesapeake Biological Laboratory. Genny is a CINAR Fellow in Quantitative Fisheries and Ecosystem Science. This workshop is funded by NOAA Fisheries QUEST program, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center, and CINARs Education program.
